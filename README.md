# International Customer Sales

An online retailer based in the UK sells all-occasion gifts, and many of their customers are whole-salers. Most customers are from the UK but a small percentage are international. The client wants to create groups of these customers based ont heri previous purchasing patterns to provide more tailored services and improve the way they market international customers. Currently the retailer groups international customers by country. This approach has three major drawbacks:

1) There is a large numebr of countries
2) Some countries have very few customers
3) Treats large and small customers the same, regardless of their purchase patterns

Project Aim: Create three customer segments based on aggregate sales patterns and specific items purchased.
